[0:00-0:05] Title & one-liner
"CancerCare Nutrition Hub — a privacy-first nutrition assistant for clinical teams."

[0:05-0:20] Problem (15s)
"Clinicians need quick, accurate nutrition data and medication-aware recommendations to support treatment decisions. Patients often struggle to track intake and side effects between visits."

[0:20-0:40] Core capabilities (20s)
"The app runs locally in the browser: daily meal and fluid logging, medication tracking with automated food–drug alerts, weekly summaries, and CSV export for the record. No PHI leaves the device."

[0:40-1:05] Clinical value (25s)
"Use weekly averages to spot calorie, protein, or hydration gaps. Medication alerts highlight interaction risks and nutrient support options. Exported CSVs attach directly to charts or dietitian handoffs."

[1:05-1:20] Quick workflow (15s)
"Ask patients to log for one week prior to review. Open Weekly History during visits, review trends, export, and incorporate findings into care planning."

[1:20-1:30] Close (10s)
"This tool is adjunctive — not a replacement for clinical judgment. Try it locally by opening index.html and share exports with your team."
